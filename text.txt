FileStream Class

Exposes a Stream around a file, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous
read and write operations.
For a list of all members of this type, see FileStream Members.
Thread Safety
Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread
safe. Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.
Remarks
Use the FileStream class to read from, write to, open, and close
files on a file system, as well as to manipulate other file-related
operating system handles such as pipes, standard input, amd standard
output. You can specify read and write operations to be either
synchronous or asynchronous. FileStream buffers input and output
for better performance.
FileStream objects support random access to files using the Seek method.
Seek allows the read/write position to be moved to any position within
the file. This is done with byte offset reference point parameters.
